# Image-Classifier-using-CNN

This project is my attempt to solve the assignment in the course CS231n as a part of the course ECEN689: Machine Learning

The project aims at:

1. Understanding Neural Networks and how they are arranged in layered architectures

2. Understanding and be able to implement (vectorized) backpropagation

3. Implementing various update rules used to optimize Neural Networks

4. Implementing Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization for training deep networks

5. Implementing Dropout to regularize networks

6. Understanding the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks and get practice with training these models on data 

7. gaining experience with a major deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
