# Image-Classifier-using-CNN

This project is my attempt to solve the assignment in the course CS231n as a part of the course ECEN689: Machine Learning

The project aims at:

1. Understanding Neural Networks and how they are arranged in layered architectures

2. Understanding and be able to implement (vectorized) backpropagation

3. Implementing various update rules used to optimize Neural Networks

4. Implementing Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization for training deep networks

5. Implementing Dropout to regularize networks

6. Understanding the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks and get practice with training these models on data 

7. gaining experience with a major deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.


# Binary classifier using SVM

Task 1:

Implemented a Decision tree classifier on the Dataset using \scikit-learn" package 

Task 2:

Implemented adaptive boosting for a decision tree classifier and adjusted the depth of the tree

Task 3:

Using the SVM classifier on the dataset, applied boostin gto SVM classifiers

Task 4:

Applying all the concepts learned, the best achieved accuracy was 85.22%  with a depth of 10.
